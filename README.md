# HPEM_Model
Hybrid Polynomial Ensemble Model (HPEM) combines Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, SVM, and XGBoost to enhance cardiovascular disease prediction. It uses mutual information for feature selection, metrics like F1-Score for evaluation, and SHAP/LIME for explainability, ensuring accuracy and transparency.
